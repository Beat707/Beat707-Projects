How to use: its actually very simple. First be sure you got the latest Beat707 software running on your Arduino board, as it has a new option to enable MIDI over USB. Start your Beat707 device and, from the Interface, find the USB MODE option and enable it. Plug the USB cable to your computer, wait a few seconds so the computer detects it and assigns a Serial port to it. Now startup Beat707_Manager, the code will check all available Serial ports until it finds a Beat707 device and initializes communication. You don't need to do anything else, just wait a few seconds.

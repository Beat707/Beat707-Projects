Welcome to the Wusik 4000 Installer.

In the next screen you will be able to select exactly where you want your Wusik 4000 files to be installed.

This installer will only install the main files, sounds will need to be installed manually. Just download each sound ZIP file and uncompress to Wusik 4000 Data\SoundSets

When you load up Wusik 4000, click the Wusik (W) logo to open the options menu.

Both data folder and plugin files can be moved. When you load the plugin it will ask where the data files are stored at.
